<p>The plugin currently provides three shortcodes:
	<ul>
		<li>[convertInt],</li>
		<li>[annuityCertain]  and</li>
		<li>[mortgage].</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>So, for instance, to have a page (not a post) on your site which has a level annuity calculator, create a new page and put the shortcode [annuityCertain] in the text of the page.</p>
<p>By default the plugin will provide both a question with randomised parameters, and a form that just calculates the answer.  If you want just the question form add the attribute answer=0.  If you want just the answer form add the attribute question=0.  E.g.  [annuityCertain answer=0] would show just an annuity question form.</p> 

<p>The shortcodes don't work in posts.</p>

<p>The plugin will generate mathjax but won't render it. So to get the generated html to look like nice formulae you probably need to install a plugin like Simple Mathjax.</p>
