Practice financial mathematics questions for the actuarial exams. Define and
calculate annuity certain, mortgage repayment schedule.

== Description ==

This plugin provides shortcodes which render forms that asks blog users to solve 
maths questions which typically appear in the CT1 actuarial exam and
the Interest Theory part of the Financial Mathematics exam.

The shortcode specifies the type of the question (e.g to calculate the amount
of a mortgage repayment) but the parameters for the question (e.g. the amount
of the loan) are randomised so that any number of questions can be generated.

Once the blog user submits the question, the plugin scores their answer and
explains the solution.
